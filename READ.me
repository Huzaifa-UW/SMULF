# SmartStudy Quiz ðŸŽ“  

SmartStudy Quiz is a simple Python-based quiz tool designed to make studying easier and more interactive.  
Instead of just reading notes, students can practice questions stored in a CSV file and get instant feedback.  

This project reflects my interest in combining programming with education â€” building tools that solve real problems students face.
